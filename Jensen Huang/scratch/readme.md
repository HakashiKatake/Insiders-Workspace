## File Naming and Description Instructions

Please ensure that you add the file names of any Python and Scratch files you create, along with a brief description of what each file is about. This will help in maintaining clarity and organization within the project.

For example:
- `day7.py`: This file contains basic arithmetic operations and calculations for geometric shapes.
- `project.scratch`: This file includes a Scratch project that demonstrates basic animation techniques.
