# Project Overview

This repository is organized into three main cohorts: Elon Musk, Jensen Huang, and Mark Zuckerberg. Each cohort is focused on learning and documenting their progress in two programming environments: Scratch and Python.

## Cohort Structure

Each cohort has its own directory, which is further divided into two subdirectories: `scratch` and `python`. These subdirectories contain the projects and exercises that the students have worked on. The students are responsible for updating the `README.md` files within these subdirectories to provide a brief description of what they have learned and accomplished.

### Cohorts

- **Elon Musk**
  - `scratch/`: Contains Scratch projects and exercises.
  - `python/`: Contains Python scripts and exercises.

- **Jensen Huang**
  - `scratch/`: Contains Scratch projects and exercises.
  - `python/`: Contains Python scripts and exercises.

- **Mark Zuckerberg**
  - `scratch/`: Contains Scratch projects and exercises.
  - `python/`: Contains Python scripts and exercises.

## Updating Progress

Students are encouraged to update the `README.md` files in their respective cohort's subdirectories with a brief description of their daily progress. This helps in maintaining clarity and organization within the project.

### Example of a README Update

In each `README.md` file, students should include:

- The file name of the project or script.
- A brief description of what the file is about.

For example:

- `day7.py`: This file contains basic arithmetic operations and calculations for geometric shapes.
- `project.scratch`: This file includes a Scratch project that demonstrates basic animation techniques.

By following this structure, we ensure that the repository remains organized and that each student's progress is clearly documented.
